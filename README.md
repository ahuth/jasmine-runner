# Jasmine Runner package

For [Atom](https://atom.io/).

While running a Jasmine server (such as with `rake jasmine`), open up specific tests from within Atom.

To use:

1. Make sure your Jasmine server is running.
2. Within your Jasmine specs, place your cursor within the test (or tests) you want to run.
3. Press `cmd-ctrl-alt-r`, which will open up your browser with the correct url to run your tests.

Also, you can press `cmd-ctrl-alt-t` to run the entire file you're in.
